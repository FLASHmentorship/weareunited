                <h2>A HYPOTHETICAL</h2>
        
                <div class="row justify-content-center mt-4">
                    <div class="col-12 col-md-10">
                        <p>One item on the above list that has raised controversy is the players’ demand of a 50% revenue share. To break this down numerically, last year the Pac-12 conference reported a total revenue of $530 million and distributed a total of $387 million (73%), equating to an average of $32.2 million per member institution. The remaining $143 million assumedly went to internal operations within the conference, though as a private entity the Pac-12 is not required to disclose these expenditures.</p>
<!--                        GRAPHIC!-->
                        <p>The member schools, however, are nonprofit institutions and therefore often find themselves spending any excess Pac-12 distribution money or internally-generated revenue on lavish sporting complex updates to avoid reporting profits – including such purchases as nap pods and excess televisions for locker rooms and hallway displays. While these updates serve their purpose when it comes to recruiting, it begs to question if these excess funds are better off in the pockets of the athletes that deliver the product of college sports, themselves. </p>
                        <p>Looking back more closely at what it might mean to have student athletes receive a 50% share of Pac-12 revenue:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>There are over 8,000 student athletes representing the sports teams of the Pac-12 conference, including both scholarship and “walk-on” athletes.</li>
                          <li>If the Pac-12 conceded 50% of its revenue to its athletes, before distribution that is $265 million and after distribution, $71.5 million. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Unrealistically, let’s imagine this money goes directly to athletes’ stipend checks, ie. monthly payments scholarship athletes receive to help cover rent and living expenses. Let’s also imagine there is no difference, in this case, between a scholarship athlete and a walk-on. That is, both will receive a stipend. If the 50% revenue share comes prior to member institution distributions (again, very unlikely) each student-athlete in the Pac-12 can expect to earn about $2,700 per month. In a slightly more reasonable case, the 50% of revenue to student-athletes after distributions means nearly $750 added to their monthly stipend. </p>
                            
                            <iframe class="mt-3 mb-3" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/446645494" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        
                        <p>These aren’t crazy numbers. Understandably, many, many other factors come into play that greatly complicate this model. Things like win-loss record and season turnout effecting player pay, as well as, cost of living adjustments and weight of high revenue sports. </p>
                        <p>Perhaps a more realistic model might look something like student athletes receiving income that they may opt to have their scholarship deducted from or pay tuition with independently from the sum. </p>
                        <p>And the bottom line is this, there is money to go around in the Pac-12 and the NCAA as a whole. Pac-12 commissioner, Larry Scott’s annual salary is $5 million. With just a fraction of this or the proposed revenue share, players can be payed for their work and programs can be put in place to support the families of the low-income student athletes Larry Scott and others so readily exploit. </p>
